linear
linear, divided by constant , still linear
linear: best scenario constant
linear
worst: linear, best: constant
worst: n*n, best n* constant = n
worst: n*n/2 => n*n

interacting:
1. m*n
2. n*(i)=> n*n/2 => n*n
3. nm

radical recursion
1. n/5 => n
2. logn
3. 2**n
4. grab_bag: 2**n
array.length = count
first n-1
